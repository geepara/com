      <p>The big problem being solved here is that higher education is too expensive.</p>
      <p>
        And it is evident that outside the top 50 universities, the ROI on a university
        diploma is negative. The salary that the diploma affords you does not match with
        the tremendous amount of debt you have to take on in order to obtain it.
      </p>
      <p>This has happened for x reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The universities can keep jacking up their prices with no significant consequences.</li>
        <li></li>
