"What? What do you mean software doesn't create value? Our entire world is built on software!"

Working on software implementations has made me think deeply about the place of software in the world. And I stumbled upon a truth that is not immediately obvious:

𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘁𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲. 𝗜𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲.

Sure, you can download an app off the App Store and get value in under 5 minutes. But that doesn't work for more complex software, especially in the real world where it has to interact with an organization of more than 20 people. You can create the most powerful software ever, but if nobody knows how to use it, it won't produce any value.

𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗱𝗼 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱.

Anyone who makes a complex software product themselves intuitively understands this. You can have the best onboarding flow and UX, but your product is useless without deployment. The deployment process is what makes the software actually useful. Without it, you end up with confused customers who churn quickly when they can't figure out how to use your product for their use cases.

This happens because software doesn't exist in a vacuum. Organizations already have their own way of doing things. It's very rare for them to adopt new software without it clashing with their preexisting workflows. Without implementation, it can be impossible for an organization to adopt new software, no matter how powerful it is.

𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗴𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲. 𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁, 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀.

We are witnessing one of the greatest transformations in how work is done. Businesses are hungry for software that's going to make them AI-native, but it won't create any value unless it aligns with how they already do work. Without that alignment, the software is useless.

Auctor sits at the heart of this change. Imagine adopting new software and it begins to produce value virtually overnight. No more long implementation processes. Just pick a product and it immediately starts driving value. This is what Auctor enables.

People always ask me: "But what does Auctor 𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 do?"
